[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mgerhardy/simpleai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgerhardy/simpleai)

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mgerhardy/simpleai/wiki) for a detailed description.

"External" dependencies are lua and tinyxml2 (both are included and can be disabled).

There is a small example application that can be used for testing and running behaviour trees.
It's called simpleiai-run.

The remote debugger network protocol can be inspected in wireshark with the included dissector
lua script.
