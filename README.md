See the [doxygen documentation](http://mgerhardy.github.io/simpleai/) for a detailed description.

"External" dependencies are lua and tinyxml2 (both are included and can be disabled).

There is a small example application that can be used for testing and running behaviour trees.
It's called simpleiai-run.

The remote debugger network protocol can be inspected in wireshark with the included dissector
lua script.
