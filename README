simpleai
========

SimpleAI is a small C++ AI behaviour tree library released under MIT.

Features:
-----------------
* LUA script interface to create the trees - but every other data source
  is possible, too. The LUA script interface is just implemented as an
  example.
* Aggro list implementation
* Several standard selectors and conditions
* Group management
* Network based remote debugging
* QT5 based remote debugger

Compile the lib:
-----------------
./configure
make
make install

Compile the remote debugger
-----------------
cd src/debugger
qmake
make

Running it:
-----------------
SimpleAI comes with a small example that is located in src/example. You can
run this with:

  ./src/example/example src/example/behaviours.lua

After you ran it, you can connect with the remote debugger and inspect the live
state of every spawned AI entity.

Using it:
-----------------
* Make sure your game character extends ICharacter or includes it as component.
* Implement your behaviour tree loader by extending the class ITreeloader.
* Extend the AIDebugger to deliver your own MapView that renders the map of
  your game.
* Add your own condition and task factories to the AIRegistry.
* Assign attributes to your game characters that should be shown in the
  debuggers live view.
